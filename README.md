# Markdown Metadata (mdmeta)

Front matter is used in the front of markdown file to indicate some metadata of a markdown file. It uses YAML format to specify values of the markdown file.

Markdown Metadata (also called `mdmeta`) is a tool to generate and manage the front matter metadata. It is a cross-platform console app based on .Net Core 2.0 and will be integrated within popular editors. Maybe some UI which is used for editing configs will appear in the future.
